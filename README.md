# Prankster's Paradise
## Description
This application is meant to be a practical prank on someone who is easily fooled. The user is asked whether they want to know how to keep a gullible person entertained for hours. If the user replies with 'yes' or 'y,' the computer will continue to ask the same question. If the user enters a 'no' or 'n' response, the application exits the loop. If the user inputs an answer that is not a 'yes' or a 'no,' the application notifies them that their response is invalid.
